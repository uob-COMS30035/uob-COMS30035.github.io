\begin{titledslide}{Teaching Strategy}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item In an ideal world this unit would both be:
    \begin{description}
    \item[Broad] Covering many ML models and methods, and
    \item[Deep] Enabling a thorough understanding of each of them
    \end{description}
  \item But time constraints makes this impossible.
  \item The unit is reasonably broad but this means that some depth
    has been sacrificed.
  \item So there is less maths than there might be (sorry about that).
  \item A key objective is that when presented with a new data
    analysis task you can choose an appropriate method (since you know
    what modelling assumptions are made by that method), and moreover
    you know where to find and use the software that implements it. 
  \end{itemize}

\begin{titledslide}{Important topics that are missing}

  Pretty much all of the \emph{Foundations} chapter of Murphy's
  \emph{Probabilistic Machine Learning An Introduction} is missing \dots
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Lots of important maths (esp.\ linear algebra)
  \item Most of statistics
  \item Dimensionality reduction
  \item Optimisation algorithms
  \item Conjugate Bayesian analysis
  \item Reinforcement learning
  \item Causal machine learning (that's my area, so it's important of course)
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{titledslide}

\begin{titledslide}{Relation to other units}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Everyone on this unit will have done:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Mathematics for Computer Science A} (COMS10014)
    \item \emph{Mathematics for Computer Science B} (COMS10013)
    \item \emph{Data Driven Computer Science} (COMS20011)
    \end{enumerate}
  \item So we don't reteach material from those units (so e.g.\ no PCA).
  \item \emph{Applied Data Science} (COMS30051) has a different `angle':
    focusing on practical issues such as data cleaning, deploying ML
    solutions, ethics of ML, etc.
  \item If you're on the MEng then \emph{Applied Deep Learning}
    (COMSM0045)``introduces the students to the latest deep
    architectures,'' and allows students ``to learn about the
    state-of-the-art in Deep Learning.''
  \item In this unit we do one week on deep learning.
  \end{itemize}
