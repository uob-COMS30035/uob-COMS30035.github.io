  \begin{itemize}
  \item In an ideal world this unit would both be:
    \begin{description}
    \item[Broad] Covering many ML models and methods, and
    \item[Deep] Enabling a thorough understanding of each of them
    \end{description}
  \item But time constraints makes this impossible.
  \item The unit is reasonably broad but this means that some depth
    has been sacrificed.
  \item So there is less maths than there might be (sorry about that).
  \item A key objective is that when presented with a new data
    analysis task you can choose an appropriate method, and moreover
    you know where to find and use the software that implements it. 
  \end{itemize}

\begin{titledslide}{Important topics that are missing}

  Pretty much all of the \emph{Foundations} chapter of Murphy's
  \emph{Probabilistic Machine Learning An Introduction} is missing \dots
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Lots of important maths (esp.\ linear algebra)
  \item Most of statistics
  \item Optimisation algorithms
  \item Conjugate Bayesian analysis
  \item Reinforcement learning
  \item Causal machine learning (that's my area, so it's important of course)
  \end{itemize}
